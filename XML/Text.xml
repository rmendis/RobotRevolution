Oh, and did we mention the robots?[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Your memory of life before the robot takeover is fading, but parts of the world are still known to you. As the Prime Minister of Canada, will you scour the frozen wasteland for resources and remnants of the old world, or hunker down in your only remaining city and hope to outlast your opponents? </Text>
